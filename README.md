# Barcode scanner field extension

This is an extension to [Espo CRM][espo], providing a barcode scanner field.

Still a work in progress, but basic functionality is there:

- Field can be set as required
- Field can be marked as having personal data

## Resources

The project uses the following great stuff made by others.

- [ZXing browser layer][zxing]
- [Store Scanner Beep][beep] by Freesound

Much appreciated, thanks!
